# MxG, TxK influenced pygame

I made this for a PROGMODX pygame task and
decided to make it's own git repo as I'm kinda
proud over the thechnical aspects of the game
even though the game it self isn't too cool.

Spriter is a script for testing sprites and
of course game.py is the script containing the
games main function. msg is the module
containting most of the game's functions and
objects.


## Possible updates:
- Player sprite point modification in update func.
